Check out my latest coding project(old link, sorry). It is a simple to-do list web app with a few features. The text input for new tasks can be toggled using the top right icon, tasks can be added, crossed off, and removed at the user’s discretion. Written using HTML/CSS/JS.

[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) offers some amazing icons that I was incredibly happy to use. And
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) offers an easily accessible, and hefty, supply of fonts for
everyone. I’m ecstatic to have found such amazing resources. Although I did run
into some problems when using the trash icon. I was continuing to get two
printed to the screen when appending the ul with li‘s. The only way I was able
to fix it was to take out the two or three lines that appended and rewrote what
I thought was the exact same code. Except for this time, no bug! Works for me!
